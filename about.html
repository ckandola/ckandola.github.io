            <h1 class="underline_on_hover">About Me</h1> 
            <p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science, with an accounting minor, at Western Washington University,
                and I graduated in Fall 2018. I have had two internships in software development since graduating,
                and started working in retail shortly before COVID hit.
            </p>
            <p>
                After cashiering for two years, I applied for a position in the store's Cash Office, which required more
                of my accounting knowledge. My tasks were clerical; I counted the money, identified and investigated 
                discrepancies, and determined whether or not I could fix them properly. I also ordered cash for the store, 
                filed and stored paperwork, and called customers for orders that were yet to be picked up. 
                I was left with very little supervision, but was trusted to get my jobs done on time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoyed my job for a while, but I am looking for a job that won't change as often as it does in retail.
                I want to be doing something important that takes advantage of my love of puzzle-solving and critical
                thinking. I want to do be a part of a team that values my input and makes decisions for everyone's benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for learning more about me!
