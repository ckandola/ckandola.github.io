            <p>
                I've seen many website interfaces that were designed for simplicity, but break easily.
                I enjoy figuring out how programs work, and I want to help make them better for 
                the users they were intended for.
            </p> 
            <p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science at Western Washington University,
                and I graduated in Fall 2018. I have had two internships in software development since graduating,
                which taught me Git, Javascript, and React.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since my second internship ended, I have been primarily self-taught, and have practiced coding through
                online tutorials like the ones in freeCodeCamp's courses. I hope to find a team to work with
                that can help me grow as a software developer while improving user experience.
