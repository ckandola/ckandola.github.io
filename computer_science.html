            <p>
                I've seen many website interfaces that were designed for simplicity, but break easily.
                I enjoy figuring out how programs work, and I wanted to help make them better for 
                the users they were intended for.
            </p> 
            <p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science at Western Washington University,
                and I graduated in Fall 2018. I had two internships in software development since graduating,
                which taught me Git, Javascript, and React.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since my second internship ended, I was primarily self-taught, and practiced coding through
                online tutorials like the ones in freeCodeCamp's courses. My hope was to find a team to work with
                to help me grow as a software developer while improving user experience. 
            </p>
            <p><em>
                I still want to program and learn more about modern coding, but my priority is finding a stable
                job. Computer science jobs tend to require 5 or more years of professional experience, so for 
                the time being I will just have to shift my focus away from coding until I can afford to do it 
                as a hobby. If a job does not center on computer science but involves some coding, I will
                definitely be interested!
